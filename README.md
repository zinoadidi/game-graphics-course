# Video Game Graphics Course
Video Game Graphics course for Estonian Entrepreneurship University of Applied Sciences, 2018

**IMPORTANT**: to run the demo and exercise code locally on your own machine, for Chrome you need to add "--allow-file-access-from-files" to your shortcut to enable the use of textures on your machine. Make sure all Chrome processes in the Task Manager are shut down before restarting Chrome with this option. Note that even rebooting won't assure this - chrome.exe processes will often occur on startup. You have to kill these by hand and then run your shortcut. See http://www.chrome-allow-file-access-from-file.com/ for more details.
